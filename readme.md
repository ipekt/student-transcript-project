# Student Transcript Project

[Systematic Program Design - Software Abstraction](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+SoftConst1x+3T2017/course/) course exercise

## Data abstraction steps to follow:

* Specifying: think about the behaviour of the class
* Using: think about the behaviour the class will perform 
* Testing: think about test cases based on specs
* Implementing: add fields to class and then implement it based tests and use cases

## Example of simple representations

This project uses second representation
